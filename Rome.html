                <p>Roman literature, was written in Latin and will always be a permanent legacy of the culture of ancient Rome. There are few works from then that are speaking about the early military history of Rome.
                The Romans should be thankful to the Greeks because their literature is based on Greek's literature. Most Roman writers copied Greek classical themes or even translated many Greek works into Latin. This was not a problem for the citizens of Rome, due to the fact that they were very well educated so many of them knew Greek and Latin. </p>
