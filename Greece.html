                <p>Ancient Greek literature is consider as an Ancient Greek language from the first texts to about the beginning of the rise of the Byzantine empire. The first initial works were two epic poems of Homer, The Lliad and The Odyssey. Besides these two epic poems, Homeric Hymns and the two  poems of Hesiod, Theogony and Works and Days, were the most important fundamental elements of the Greek literary tradition.
                Homer's works remain great in the Greek literatury because of their skillful and colorful expressions of war and peace, honor and shame, love and hatred.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row-sm-4">
                <p>Despite the fact that the Greeks were inspired and thus established epic and lyrical forms of poetry, they succeeded in inventing drama and making masterpieces of tragedy and comedy which are still considered to be the one of the crowned performances of the piece to date.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row-md-4">
                <p>The first form of drama was developed by Greeks during dances and songs of sacred rituals, where singers were replaced by dancers. Initially, there was only one solo actor who showed various moods or characters. Many things have changed in Athens since the 5th century. From 525 to 456 BC, Ashilus and Sophocles wanted to give more emphasis on acting than on singing by increasing the role of solo actors and dialogues and decreasing the character of the choir. While on the other side, from 484 to 406 BC, Euripides tried to give more importance on deep human emotions by using the dialogue.</p>

                <h3>Greek epic poetry</h3>
                  <p><em>Greek epic poetry</em> is considered as a form of narrative literature which shows how a heroic or mythological person or a group of people live and work. The traditional metre of epic poetry consists of six metrical feet, starts with the first five feet that are dactyl, which has one long and two short syllables or a spondee that has two long syllables, and it always ends with a last foot, a spondee. The epic poems are usually long while their rhythm  varies from line to line in order not to make them monotonous. Poetry followed by the lyre is known as a brief poem that express author’s feelings. These poetries can be represented as strophes, antistrophes and epodes. All of them are sung by the Chorus, just their movements are different. Lyric poems work on the perspective of the subject of the strophe and antistrophe and  they try to find a solution for the issues that are underlined. A kind of lyric poem, mournful, melancholic or plaintive nature were Elegies that were followed by a flute instead of lyre. These poems were made of a dactylic hexameter.</p>

                <h3>The tragedy of Attica</h3>
                <p>It all started in the 6th Century in the Greek theatre. According to <em>the Greek drama</em>, only men could be a drama writer in classical Greek theatre.The drama writer wrote choruses and woman parts and produced the music, compose a performance of dance and choose the actors. First a Chorus was presented as a group of characters and then a Chorus which had a solo masked actor, reciting the story in verse. The Chorus delivered a large part of the exhibition and presented poetry on subjects. The one who changed the drama art, was Aeschylus, he introduced two masked actors and Chorus with different playing parts in the piece. While Sophocles used three and more actors, who made the piece more complexive. This art form was not natural, because the performances were not divided into works or scenes, although the action of most Greek tragedies was limited to a period of twenty-four hours, time can also be transmitted in a non-naturalistic way. By agreement, distant, violent or complex actions were not directly dramatized, but they took place outside the scene and were then described on the spot by a courier. In the Greek dramas, the structure of tragedies was formed from dialogue – episodes into choral poems – stasimon, where stasimon was divided in ceilings and antitrophies. Some plays started with a monologue or prologue, which was followed by Chorus as a horrors poems, called paradoxes. The play was finished with ekodos.</p>
                <p>To the 5th  Century, The Dionisia drama, which was made in the honor of the god of the theatre, Dionisus, was a yearly drama festivanl of Athens. This drama was a great event which last for a period of four to five days and was followed by more than 10,000 people. Every three days, three presentations of tragedy and satirical were written by one of the three pre-selected tragedy writer and comedy writer, at the end the jury awarded for the first time, second and third prizes. The other religious and dramatic yearly festival of Athens was Lenaia. This drama was open only for the residents of Athens and was more inclined to comedy.</p>

                <h3>Old, Middle and New Greek Comedy</h3>
                <p><em>The old comedy</em> is know as a very current political satire, especially adapted to the public, which often houses certain public figures with the help of individualized masks and often indecent greed to men and gods. Nowadays he survives largely in the form of eleven surviving performances by Aristophanes. The metric rhythms of the old comedy are typical doorposts, Trocha and anapestic. For <em>the middle comedy</em> it can be said that only short fragments are preserved.  <em>The new comedy</em> relies heavily on characters and it seldom criticize or improve the society that was described, also presented a love interest as the most important element in the drama. Nowadays it is mainly known for important papyrus fragments from Menander.</p>
                <p>The major elements of the Greek comedy were the parody - an access to Chorus, song or singing verses, one or more parabases – when the Chorus is directly addressed to the public, agon – a formal discussion among protagonists and antagonists, often with Chorus as a judge and the episodes – a non formal conversation among characters, conventionally in the  quantitative meter. Comedies could usually be seen at the Lenaia Festival in Athens, with same religious and dramatic yearly festival in the reputable Dionysius, although comedies could also be seen on Dionysus in later years.</p>
                <p>Ancient Greek literature had a great influence on later Greek literature and Western literature in general. More specifically, many ancient Roman authors are accustomed to their Greek predecessors. Since the Renaissance, European authors in general, including Dante Alighieri, Villiam Shakespeare, John Milton and James Joice, all have great appeal for classic themes and motifs.</p></div>
