                <p> The period from 1660 to 1689 was marked as <strong>Restoration Literature</strong> or <em>English Restoration</em> at the time of <em>Stuart period</em>. English Restoration refers to homogeneous styles of literature on the basis of a celebration or reaction to the renewed court of <em>Charles II</em>. This literature involve extreme terms because it features both Paradise Lost and the Earl of Rochester Sodom, sexual comedy with his wife Countri The Woman and The Pilgrim's Progress of moral wisdom. The Locke's Treatiste of Government was sien, then the Royal Society founding, the observations and holy meditations of Robert Boyle, the hysterical attacks on theaters of Jeremy Kosher and a pioneer in the field of literary criticism from John Dryden and John Dennis. This period was a witness of a news that become a merchandise and a beginning of a period when the essay become a part of art form and the start of textual criticism.</p>

                <div class="row-sm-4">
                <p>The dates for Restoration literature are vary considerably from genre to genre, so the drama form in the period of Restoration can last until 1700 and the poetry exist only until 1666. In sum the term "Restoration" was used by scientists as to signify the Literature that  has begun and flourished under Charles II, regardless the literature was commendable ode that created a new life with renewed aristocracy, the eschatological literature had indicated on the growth hopelessness of Puritans and it showed how the literature made changes in the communication and trade that followed in the wake of England's mercantile empire. </p>

                <p>The period between 1660 and 1714 was a period when young English writers were born. For this reason, the contemporary authorship began in the fields of author’s legislation, widespread identification of the author on the cover, "the writer of profession," Accounting as a commercial enterprise, literary "market" periodic essays and political journalism. It is usually for the literary history that the literary life of the restoration was mainly happened around the court. From the writing at the beginning of eighteenth it can be seen that many writers have changed the characteristic of the voice and make it more cultivated. No matter on who specifically the writer has addressed, it looks like the strongest feeling of the presence it stays on the thoughtful reader who is instigated, instructed, cursed or just redirected.</p>

                    <p><strong>French</strong> literature of the 17th century was during the Great French village, that the reign of Henry IV of France, Regency of Marie de Medici, Louis XIII of France, Regency of Anne of Austria (and civil war, known as the Fronde) and the reign written by Louis XIV of France. Literature of this period is often equated with a long reign of Louis XIV classicism, in which France took Europe into political and cultural development. Moreover, the beginning of the seventeenth century in French was represented as characteristical stop from the legacy of the war and native religious violence that interrupted the last forty years of the sixteenth century.</p>
                    
                    <p>In order to achieve this delay, Henri IV was transferred from Protestantism to Catholicism in 1595, and few years later he declared Nantes’s edict which is a imperial ordinance which made a limitation on religious tolerance in the land of Huguenots, called French Protestants. The internal policies of France was not responsible for vanishing the religious controversy. In year 1610, Henri IV was killed by a Catholic fanatic, however, the peace that he made lasted until Louis XIV recall the edict in year 1685 and made  French protestants to move abroad or proselyte.</p>
                    
                    <p>In the period from 1610 and 1685, the culture across the country was influenced by the recognizable form of French absolutism. Until this day, the royal patronage of art is still organized around the academies, thanks to the descendants. One of considerable effects on the literary culture had the foundation of the Academie Francaise, which was arranged by Cardinal Richelieu in year 1630 in order to restore standards of the use and rhetoric in the language. Shortly it got an important role in forming literary French and the drama French form, however, his growth in fame was exacerbated by the increasing refinement of rhetoric that was defended in court and between the respected elites in France since the end of the XVI century.</p>
