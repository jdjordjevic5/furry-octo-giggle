                <p> The period from 1660 to 1689 was marked as Restoration Literature or English Restoration at the time of Stuart period. English Restoration refers to homogeneous styles of literature on the basis of a celebration or reaction to the renewed court of Charles II. This literature involve extreme terms because it features both Paradise Lost and the Earl of Rochester Sodom, sexual comedy with his wife Countri The Woman and The Pilgrim's Progress of moral wisdom. The Locke's Treatiste of Government was sien, then the Royal Society founding, the observations and holy meditations of Robert Boyle, the hysterical attacks on theaters of Jeremy Kosher and a pioneer in the field of literary criticism from John Dryden and John Dennis. This period was a witness of a news that become a merchandise and a beginning of a period when the essay become a part of art form and the start of textual criticism.</p>
                <p>The dates for Restoration literature are vary considerably from genre to genre, so the drama form in the period of Restoration can last until 1700 and the poetry exist only until 1666. In sum the term "Restoration" was used by scientists as to signify the Literature that  has begun and flourished under Charles II, regardless the literature was commendable ode that created a new life with renewed aristocracy, the eschatological literature had indicated on the growth hopelessness of Puritans and it showed how the literature made changes in the communication and trade that followed in the wake of England's mercantile empire. </p>
                <p>The period between 1660 and 1714 was a period when young English writers were born. For this reason, the contemporary authorship began in the fields of authorâ€™s legislation, widespread identification of the author on the cover, "the writer of profession," Accounting as a commercial enterprise, literary "market" periodic essays and political journalism. It is usually for the literary history that the literary life of the restoration was mainly happened around the court. From the writing at the beginning of eighteenth it can be seen that many writers have changed the characteristic of the voice and make it more cultivated. No matter on who specifically the writer has addressed, it looks like the strongest feeling of the presence it stays on the thoughtful reader who is instigated, instructed, cursed or just redirected.</p>
